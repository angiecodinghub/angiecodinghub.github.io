</p><p>We had a blast working on this project. It took us quite an amount of time to come up with a smart encoding for the start state, the goal state, the operator encodings, the frame axioms, and the operator exclusion. 
Additionally, high level of precision was required to build a robust software, and it was hard to debug. Thankfully, we arrived at a great outcome, and it was highly satisfiable.</p>

</p><p>As the technical lead of this project, my main job is to design the APIs of the game. It was quite a fun ride coming up with the APIs and the structure of the game from scratch; 
and since I have to think about the project in the big picture in order to distribute the coding sections gracefully to the developers and jump in whenever technical problems arise, I got very familiar with the project.
I had a great time working on this project and I’m very fond of the outcomes.</p>

</p><p>As a developer of this project, I was mostly in charge of the GUI design of the frontend. Since I had no prior frontend experience before this, I spent some time teaching myself react.js. 
This project made me realized that frontend is also my cup of tea; I very much enjoyed the somewhat real-time change that we can visualize with the frontend.</p>

</p><p>My dear friend and I came up with this project for our final presentation of the course - Applications of AI Neural Network Models.
Hopefully, it showcased our capability of dealing with both visual and audio data and both the problems of classification and generation. We learned a lot and had a blast while making this.</p>
